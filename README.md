# StartpagePlox
I wanted a startpage so I made one

## Preview
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alplox/rice/master/assets/images/previews/StartpagePlox%20v2.png)](https://alplox.github.io/StartpagePlox/)
This is the first project I did from scratch while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I took inspiration from a lot of sources and end it mixing components from a few startpages that I found (as you can see in the [NOTICE](https://github.com/Alplox/StartpagePlox/blob/main/NOTICE.md)).

## Here are some of the sites from where I took stuff to make this startpage
*This same list can be found, again, in the [NOTICE](https://github.com/Alplox/StartpagePlox/blob/main/NOTICE.md) file of the repository.
