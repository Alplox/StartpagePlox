# StartpagePlox
I wanted a startpage so I made one

[Live](https://alplox.github.io/StartpagePlox/)

## Preview
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alplox/StartpagePlox/master/StartpagePlox.png)](https://alplox.github.io/StartpagePlox/)
This is the first project I did from scratch while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I took inspiration from a lot of sources and end it mixing components from a few startpages that I found (as you can see in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/Alplox/StartpagePlox/blob/main/LICENSE) doc).

## Here you will find the sources for some of the things that I used while making this startpage
*This same list can be found, again, in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/Alplox/StartpagePlox/blob/main/LICENSE) file of the repository.
