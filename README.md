# StartpagePlox
I wanted a startpage so I made one

## Preview
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alplox/StartpagePlox/master/StartpagePlox.png)](https://alplox.github.io/StartpagePlox/)
 This is the first project that I made from cero while learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I took inspiration from a lot of sources and end it mixing component from a few startpages that I found (as you can see in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/Alplox/StartpagePlox/blob/main/LICENSE) doc).

## Here you will find the sources for some of the things that I use while making this startpage
*This same list can be found, again, in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/Alplox/StartpagePlox/blob/main/LICENSE) file of the repository.
