Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION 
ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING 
THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES 
RESULTING FROM ITS USE. 

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS 
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS 
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE 
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW 
IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT 
AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT 
THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS 
YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE 
OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work 
   and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, 
   derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a 
   literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and 
   includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which 
   the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any 
   form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work 
   that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation 
   for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, 
   where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, 
   the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving 
   image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the 
   purpose of this License.

   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, 
   such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms 
   or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works 
   listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection 
   and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual 
   creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in 
   unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, 
   each constituting separate and independent works in themselves,
   which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work 
   that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an 
   Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

   c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the 
   original and copies of the Work through sale or other 
   transfer of ownership.

   or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

   e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or 
   artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities 
   who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, 
   the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance 
   the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, 
   sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform 
   literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in 
   the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal 
   entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other 
   sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization 
   that transmits the broadcast.

   f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under 
   the terms of this License including without limitation any

   entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or 
   without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated 
   works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;

   works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work 
   of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or 
   three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,

   a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a 
   copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus 
   performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a 
   literary or artistic work.

   g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights 
   under this License who has not previously violated the 
   terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who 
   has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise 
   rights under this License despite a previous violation.

   h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations 
   of the Work and to communicate to the public those public 
   recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or 
   wireless means or public digital performances; to make 
   available to the public Works in such a way that members 
   of the public may access these Works from a place and at 
   a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work 
   to the public by any means or process and the communication 
   to the public of the performances of the Work, including 
   by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast 
   the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.

   i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any 
   means including without limitation by sound or visual 
   recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing 
   fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected

   electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. 
Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, 
or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising 
from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in 
connection with the copyright protection under copyright 
law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, 
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the 
applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights 
in the Work as stated below:

   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work 
   into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce 
   the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,

   b. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work 
   including as incorporated in Collections.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and 
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. 
The above rights include the right to make such 
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise 
the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise 
you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to 8(f), 
all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby 
reserved, including but not limited to the rights 
set forth in Section 4(d).

4. Restrictions. 
The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly 
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work 
   only under the terms of this License. You must include 
   a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, 
   this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute 
   or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any 
   terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this 
   License or the ability of the recipient of the Work 
   to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under 
   the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. 
   You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License 
   and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the 
   Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute 
   or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective 
   technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability 
   of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
   granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. 
   This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in 
   a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart 
   from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of 
   this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from 
   any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove 
   from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), 
   as requested.

   b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You 
   in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended 
   for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary 
   compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted 
   works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not 
   be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial 
   advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is 
   no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the 
   exchange of copyrighted works.

   c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, 
   You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), 
   keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, 
   reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) 
   the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) 
   if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor 
   designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, 
   publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") 
   in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable 
   means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work 
   if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if 
   any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless 
   such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information 
   for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be 
   implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that 
   in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, 
   if a credit for all contributing authors of Collection appears, 
   then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent 
   as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance 
   of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for 
   the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by 
   exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly 
   or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or 
   endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution 
   Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without 
   the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, 
   Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

   d. For the avoidance of doubt:

      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions 
      in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or 
      compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves 
      the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by 
      You of the rights granted under this License;

      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in 
      which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or 
      compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves 
      the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by 
      You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such 
      rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial 
      as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to 
      collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to 
      collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the 
      Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers 
      voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise 
      by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a 
      purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).

   e. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be 
   otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or 
   Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Collections, 
   You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in 
   relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS 
AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, 
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, 
MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE 
OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER 
OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. 

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE 
TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR 
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR 
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically 
   upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities 
   who have received Collections from You under this License, however, will not 
   have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in 
   full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive 
   any termination of this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual 
   (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, 
   Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to 
   stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will 
   not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required 
   to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full 
   force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the 
   Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and 
   conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under 
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the 
   remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the 
   parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
   extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach 
   consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by 
   the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

   d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with 
   respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements 
   or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor 
   shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any 
   communication from You. This License may not be modified without the 
   mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

   e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this 
   License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention 
   for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on 
   September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright 
   Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 
   and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). 
   These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant 
   jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced 
   according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of 
   those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard 
   suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes 
   additional rights not granted under this License, such additional 
   rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is 
   not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
